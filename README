README file for project GPSDisplay
============================================================================

This is the project GPSDisplay. The initial goal of the project is to
have a similar device like the one described in FA 4/09 pg. 403 [1].

The original device is based on a PIC 18F252 and uses a Navilock NL-504ETTL or
NL-501ETTL (Sirf3) as GPS module. By pressing a button one can schange the
text displayed at the LCD between different display modes.

The GPS decoding routines stem mainly from the WhereAVR project of G.Dion
(N4TXI) - see also ref. [2].

The LCD routines are taken from the library of P.Fleury [3]. Optionally, his
UART routines can be used, too.

The button input routine is the 'famous' debounce code of Peter Danegger [4].

The used GPS module is a Garmin GPS25-LVC (12-channel receiver) [5].

The second version is using the NAVILOCK NL303P GPS module, its pinout is
described here [6] (and in this file).

Pin  Pin name                Description
 1   GND (black)             Ground signal for power and data
 2   VCC +5V (red)           Power supply voltage to GPS +5V
 3   Data TTL Rx (blue)      Data to GPS, TTL levels
 4   Data RS-232 Rx (white)  Data to GPS, RS-232 levels
 5   Data RS-232 Tx (green)  Data from GPS, RS-232 levels
 6   Data TTL Tx (yellow)    Data from GPS, TTL levels

This is how the LCD (2x16) is connected to the Atmel uController:

   DATA0..3 = PC0..3
   RS	    = PD3
   RW	    = PD4
   E	    = PD5
